Enable left-right arrow key navigation between Tumblr pages.

This doesn't try to be fancy and will "work" on pages on which it should
not, but I'm not concerned enough about that to fix it.

If you're viewing a tumblr and you're on page, say, 2, and you press the
left arrow key, you'll go to page 1; press the right arrow key and you'll go
to page 3.

It doesn't care if page 1 or page 3 don't exist or don't make sense given
the page that you're on.  Most of them time, though, it just does what you
want when you want it to.
